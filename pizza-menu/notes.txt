React applications are entirely made out of components.

The building block of React Applications are components.

The component based architecture of a React app makes it very easy to reuse components. 

Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components down the component tree.

Props is the data comin from the outside, and can only be updated by the parent component.

State is internal data that can be updated by the component's logic.

Props are read-only, they are immutable. They cannot be changed.

And if you feel you need to constantly change data, what you need to use is state. Bacause states data can be changed with logic.

React uses a one-way data flow, what this means is that...

In React applications, data can only be passed from parents to child components and this is done useing props.

There are two ways to approach conditional rendering in React;
1. Using the ternary operator
2. Using short-circuiting and logica operators.
